# SAFE Labs Handbook
This Lab Culture Handbook is an outcome of the 2024 SAFE Labs workshop: a global engagement initiative, bringing together new bioscience group leaders from across Europe to discuss Starting Aware, Fair, and Equitable Labs. This workshop highlighted the need for resource with actionable “commitments” for a group leader to create a more positive and inclusive lab environment. Existing resources provided general advice, but not specific actions that group leaders could take. <br/>
<br/>
There is no “correct” way to run a research group: approaches vary across groups, institutions, and countries. Consequently, rather than being prescriptive, we aim to increase transparency and minimise any expectation mismatch between the group leader and lab members to create positive and equitable lab culture. Here, we present commitments that span different topics: Policies, Teams, and Careers. No commitment relies on institutional support to implement, and all commitments are actionable, and can be verifiably implemented. This is because:
1)	Implementable commitments are the most helpful to group leaders and lab members.
2)	Verifiable commitments allow for accountability and specific feedback.

For example, “I commit to supporting a healthy work-life balance for my lab members” will not be in this handbook because the commitment cannot be verified.<br/>
<br/>
This handbook does not represent an optimal or exhaustive list: it is the product of thirteen group leaders who are all passionate about improving lab culture, and are all fallible. The handbook will improve through community feedback and further dedicated workshops. Labs that implement—or intend to implement within 3 months—all commitments, should feature the SAFE Labs logo on their website, and should register for the SAFE Labs mailing list. <br/>

## Sections for each commitment:
_**Details:**_ Here we include more details on the commitment, including the reasoning behind it, and any requirements (e.g. if a statement must include a particular piece of information).<br/>
<br/>
_**Suggestions:**_ We may include suggestions of aspects that should be considered when fulfilling the commitment. These may contain multiple alternatives and are not requirements.<br/>
<br/>
_**Example:**_ We may include an example (e.g. for a documented statement). These can be copied, used as guides, or completely changed. Their relevance may vary due to country/institutional differences. <br/>
## Key terminology:
_**Publicly Document:**_ A written record on the lab website that is visible to anyone. This allows applicants to make informed decisions, and minimizes expectation mismatch. Publicly documenting traditionally obscured information can be uncomfortable—it was for us. For each commitment, we asked ourselves: Would this information be useful if I were applying to a lab? Is there a strong reason to withhold this information? We hope you agree with our classifications, but if not, tell us why!<br/>
<br/>
_**Document:**_ A written record that is visible to lab members, but not necessarily to anyone visiting the lab website. For example, on a “Lab Wiki”, “Slack Canvas”, or another shared document. This information can also be publicly documented, but this is not required.   <br/>
<br/>
_**Establish:**_ This requires implementing a new (if not already established) policy/process/event. Not as immediately achievable as documenting something, but does not require institutional support.<br/>

# Commitments
## SAFE Policies
**I commit to _publicly document_ …**
<details>
<summary> <b> <code>... a diversity statement.</code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i><b>Details: </b> Science is an international endeavour, which brings together people from many cultures. This statement is an opportunity to specify the steps you, and your institution, have taken to support a diversity of researchers with differing needs and backgrounds. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Suggestions:</b> <br/>
-Make clear what are the institutional rules for maternity and paternity leave. <br/>
-Normalize specifying pronouns in email signatures and profiles (e.g. slack). <br/>
-Encourage people to share and mark on the lab calendar crucial cultural events/festivities. <br/>
-Encourage attendance of EDI training. <br/>
-Discuss steps taken to facilitate diversity in applicants. <br/>
-During onboarding, discuss cultural needs (e.g. religious holidays, prayer facilities). <br/>
-Dedicate some meetings (e.g. journal club) to papers addressing diversity in science. <br/>
-Consider diversity of voices when selecting papers in journal clubs. <br/>
  <br/>
<b>Example: </b> <br/>
Our lab fosters a diverse and inclusive environment. We believe that diversity is a resource to harness, and we strive to create a psychologically safe environment where disruptive points of view are valued. We encourage individuals from different cultural, socioeconomic, gender, and geographical backgrounds to join.</i>

<summary> <b> <code>... the lab code of conduct: emphasise welfare, equity and integrity.</code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i><b>Details: </b> A prominent code of conduct should help to establish the lab atmosphere, foster synergy and collaboration, and make lab members feel valued and respected. It will set boundaries and shared practices, and establish a common framework to reduce and resolve conflict.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Suggestions:</b> <br/>
-Set out expectations for professional behaviour. <br/>
-Include timekeeping for meetings, work requests, and assignments. <br/>
-Require engagement with presentations, opinions, and requests from other members. <br/>
-Avoid exclusive communication channels (e.g. cc everyone when applicable). <br/>
<br/>
<b>Example: </b> <br/>
All lab members are expected to maintain a professional attitude of integrity, accountability, and mutual respect in all interactions and endeavours while upholding high standards of scientific rigor and collaboration. Examples include respecting each other’s points of views and contributions to discussions, being timely for meetings, and actively engaging in each other’s presentations. Everyone commits to maintaining an inclusive environment marked by compassionate behaviour and free from offensive conduct, particularly regarding gender, race, sexuality, or disability. Lab members are free to voice their ideas, wishes, or concerns without risking negative consequences ensuring a psychologically safe environment.</i>

<summary> <b> <code> ... green initiatives in the lab and any explicit rules related to sustainability. </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i><b>Details: </b> Laboratories consume a lot of energy and produce a lot of waste. Group leaders are able to promote measures that reduce the environmental impact of scientific research, and prospective lab members may use environmental awareness as a factor when choosing labs. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Suggestions:</b> <br/>
-Require sustainable transport options when travel time is < 8 hours.  <br/>
-Recycle non-hazardous waste. <br/>
-Place orders in bulk to reduce shipments.  <br/> 
-Have a list of instruments you are happy to share with your internal collaborators.  <br/>
-Donate unused equipment within/outside the institutions.  <br/>
-Highlight schemes that incentivise sustainable commuting (e.g. cycle schemes).  <br/>
  <br/>
<b>Example: </b> <br/>
The lab strives to minimise energy consumption and waste production. We identified three main areas of impact: travel, recycling and economical use of equipment. <br/>
<br/>
Travel: I encourage sustainable transport options both for long-haul travel and for daily commute. For long-hauls trips, when funding allows, I will cover the most sustainable travel option (up to double the price of the cheapest alternative). I also recognise remote-working hours spent productively on sustainable means of transport during private (non-work related) trips. I incentivize sustainable options for daily commute: PhD students enrolled at University of Trento benefit from free public transportation across the Trentino region; all the lab members can participate in an annual contest where commuting milage is logged and scored according to sustainability of the means of transport, the person who accrues the most points wins.<br/>
<br/>
Recycling: To minimize the environmental impact of lab waste, we avoid mixing truly contaminated materials (which is expensive and environmentally harmful to safely dispose of) with clean recyclable waste. We equip our lab with additional recycling bins and take responsibility for disposing of the recovered recyclables according to local <br/>regulations. 
<br/>
Economical use of equipment: when possible and not detrimental our instruments, we turn off unused equipment when prolonged downtime is forecasted.<br/>

<summary> <b> <code> ... the common lab language and any institutional language requirements. </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i><b>Details: </b> English is the international language of science in the 21st century: proficiency in English is a crucial skill to nurture for every scientist. However, lab members are often not native English speakers, and in some cases the Institutional language may not be English. It is therefore important to document the lab and institutional language policy (even in “obvious” cases). To help non-native English speakers—or non-native speakers of the local language—it is also valuable to highlight any institutional support for language acquisition. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Suggestions:</b> <br/>
-Identify English as the lab language, and document language code of conduct. <br/>
-Lead by example and adopt the most inclusive communication format. <br/>
-Clearly indicate language requirements in job posts. <br/>
-Document available training in English, particularly scientific writing and presentation. <br/>
-Document available training in the Institutional and/or local language.  <br/>
-Document lab policy about using LLMs (i.e. ChatGPT) to improve written output. <br/>
-Address language barriers in meetings, adopting formats of Q/A that facilitate feedback. <br/>
  <br/>
<b>Example: </b> <br/>
The lab language is English. Any professional conversation, oral and written, during work activities must be in English: these include presentations and discussion at lab meetings, scientific output, and email exchanges. Feel free to use LLMs to proofread and refine written text. However, fully AI generated text is not acceptable. Outside of professional meetings, the lab strives for inclusive communication: verbal exchanges should adopt the common language that allow everyone present to participate. <br/>
<br/>
The institutional language at the Italian Institute of Technology is English; nonetheless, many administrative exchanges and Italian bureaucracy are still in Italian. Proficiency in Italian is therefore useful within the institute, as well as when traveling throughout the country. Please refer to the lab Wiki to access learning resources. <br/>

<br/>
<i><b>Details: </b> A clear and current list of lab members allows prospective applicants to gauge the size and composition of the lab. Unless otherwise requested, contact details for each person should be included. Adding alumni indicates the range of roles that lab members move into after leaving, and provides an avenue to gain more information about joining, working in, and leaving the lab. </i>
