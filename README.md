<details>
<summary> <b><i>… publicly document</i></b> a diversity statement.</summary>
<br/>
<i><b>Details: </b> Science is an international endeavour, which brings together people from many cultures. This statement is an opportunity to specify the steps you, and your institution, have taken to support a diversity of researchers with differing needs and backgrounds. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Suggestions:</b> <br/>
-Make clear what are the institutional rules for maternity and paternity leave. <br/>
-Normalize specifying pronouns in email signatures and profiles (e.g. slack). <br/>
-Encourage people to share and mark on the lab calendar crucial cultural events/festivities. <br/>
-Encourage attendance of EDI training. <br/>
-Discuss steps taken to facilitate diversity in applicants. <br/>
-During onboarding, discuss cultural needs (e.g. religious holidays, prayer facilities). <br/>
-Dedicate some meetings (e.g. journal club) to papers addressing diversity in science. <br/>
-Consider diversity of voices when selecting papers in journal clubs. <br/>
  <br/>
<b>Example: </b> Our lab fosters a diverse and inclusive environment. We believe that diversity is a resource to harness, and we strive to create a psychologically safe environment where disruptive points of view are valued. We encourage individuals from different cultural, socioeconomic, gender, and geographical backgrounds to join.</i>

<summary> <b><i>… publicly document</i></b> a list of lab members and alumni.</summary>
<i><b>Details: </b> A clear and current list of lab members allows prospective applicants to gauge the size and composition of the lab. Unless otherwise requested, contact details for each person should be included. Adding alumni indicates the range of roles that lab members move into after leaving, and provides an avenue to gain more information about joining, working in, and leaving the lab. </i>
