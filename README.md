# SAFE Labs Handbook
This Lab Culture Handbook is an outcome of the 2024 SAFE Labs workshop: a global engagement initiative, bringing together new bioscience group leaders from across Europe to discuss Starting Aware, Fair, and Equitable Labs. This workshop highlighted the need for resource with actionable “commitments” for a group leader to create a more positive and inclusive lab environment. Existing resources provided general advice, but not specific actions that group leaders could take. <br/>
<br/>
There is no “correct” way to run a research group: approaches vary across groups, institutions, and countries. Consequently, rather than being prescriptive, we aim to increase transparency and minimise any expectation mismatch between the group leader and lab members to create positive and equitable lab culture. Here, we present commitments that span different topics: Policies, Teams, and Careers. No commitment relies on institutional support to implement, and all commitments are actionable, and can be verifiably implemented. This is because:
1)	Implementable commitments are the most helpful to group leaders and lab members.
2)	Verifiable commitments allow for accountability and specific feedback.

For example, “I commit to supporting a healthy work-life balance for my lab members” will not be in this handbook because the commitment cannot be verified.<br/>
<br/>
This handbook does not represent an optimal or exhaustive list: it is the product of thirteen group leaders who are all passionate about improving lab culture, and are all fallible. The handbook will improve through community feedback and further dedicated workshops. Labs that implement—or intend to implement within 3 months—all commitments, should feature the SAFE Labs logo on their website, and should register for the SAFE Labs mailing list. <br/>

## Sections for each commitment:
_**Details:**_ Here we include more details on the commitment, including the reasoning behind it, and any requirements (e.g. if a statement must include a particular piece of information).<br/>
<br/>
_**Suggestions:**_ We may include suggestions of aspects that should be considered when fulfilling the commitment. These may contain multiple alternatives and are not requirements.<br/>
<br/>
_**Example:**_ We may include an example (e.g. for a documented statement). These can be copied, used as guides, or completely changed. Their relevance may vary due to country/institutional differences. <br/>
## Key terminology:
_**Publicly Document:**_ A written record on the lab website that is visible to anyone. This allows applicants to make informed decisions, and minimizes expectation mismatch. Publicly documenting traditionally obscured information can be uncomfortable—it was for us. For each commitment, we asked ourselves: Would this information be useful if I were applying to a lab? Is there a strong reason to withhold this information? We hope you agree with our classifications, but if not, tell us why!<br/>
<br/>
_**Document:**_ A written record that is visible to lab members, but not necessarily to anyone visiting the lab website. For example, on a “Lab Wiki”, “Slack Canvas”, or another shared document. This information can also be publicly documented, but this is not required.   <br/>
<br/>
_**Establish:**_ This requires implementing a new (if not already established) policy/process/event. Not as immediately achievable as documenting something, but does not require institutional support.<br/>

# Commitments
## SAFE Policies
**I commit to _publicly document_ …**
<details>
<summary> <b> <code>... a diversity statement.</code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i><b>Details: </b> Science is an international endeavour, which brings together people from many cultures. This statement is an opportunity to specify the steps you, and your institution, have taken to support a diversity of researchers with differing needs and backgrounds. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Suggestions:</b> <br/>
-Make clear what are the institutional rules for maternity and paternity leave. <br/>
-Normalize specifying pronouns in email signatures and profiles (e.g. slack). <br/>
-Encourage people to share and mark on the lab calendar crucial cultural events/festivities. <br/>
-Encourage attendance of EDI training. <br/>
-Discuss steps taken to facilitate diversity in applicants. <br/>
-During onboarding, discuss cultural needs (e.g. religious holidays, prayer facilities). <br/>
-Dedicate some meetings (e.g. journal club) to papers addressing diversity in science. <br/>
-Consider diversity of voices when selecting papers in journal clubs. <br/>
  <br/>
<b>Example: </b> <br/>
Our lab fosters a diverse and inclusive environment. We believe that diversity is a resource to harness, and we strive to create a psychologically safe environment where disruptive points of view are valued. We encourage individuals from different cultural, socioeconomic, gender, and geographical backgrounds to join.</i>
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b> <code>... the lab code of conduct: emphasise welfare, equity and integrity.</code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i><b>Details: </b> A prominent code of conduct should help to establish the lab atmosphere, foster synergy and collaboration, and make lab members feel valued and respected. It will set boundaries and shared practices, and establish a common framework to reduce and resolve conflict.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Suggestions:</b> <br/>
-Set out expectations for professional behaviour. <br/>
-Include timekeeping for meetings, work requests, and assignments. <br/>
-Require engagement with presentations, opinions, and requests from other members. <br/>
-Avoid exclusive communication channels (e.g. cc everyone when applicable). <br/>
<br/>
<b>Example: </b> <br/>
All lab members are expected to maintain a professional attitude of integrity, accountability, and mutual respect in all interactions and endeavours while upholding high standards of scientific rigor and collaboration. Examples include respecting each other’s points of views and contributions to discussions, being timely for meetings, and actively engaging in each other’s presentations. Everyone commits to maintaining an inclusive environment marked by compassionate behaviour and free from offensive conduct, particularly regarding gender, race, sexuality, or disability. Lab members are free to voice their ideas, wishes, or concerns without risking negative consequences ensuring a psychologically safe environment.</i>
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b> <code> ... green initiatives in the lab and any explicit rules related to sustainability. </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i><b>Details: </b> Laboratories consume a lot of energy and produce a lot of waste. Group leaders are able to promote measures that reduce the environmental impact of scientific research, and prospective lab members may use environmental awareness as a factor when choosing labs. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Suggestions:</b> <br/>
-Require sustainable transport options when travel time is < 8 hours.  <br/>
-Recycle non-hazardous waste. <br/>
-Place orders in bulk to reduce shipments.  <br/> 
-Have a list of instruments you are happy to share with your internal collaborators.  <br/>
-Donate unused equipment within/outside the institutions.  <br/>
-Highlight schemes that incentivise sustainable commuting (e.g. cycle schemes).  <br/>
  <br/>
<b>Example: </b> <br/>
The lab strives to minimise energy consumption and waste production. We identified three main areas of impact: travel, recycling and economical use of equipment. <br/>
<br/>
Travel: I encourage sustainable transport options both for long-haul travel and for daily commute. For long-hauls trips, when funding allows, I will cover the most sustainable travel option (up to double the price of the cheapest alternative). I also recognise remote-working hours spent productively on sustainable means of transport during private (non-work related) trips. I incentivize sustainable options for daily commute: PhD students enrolled at University of Trento benefit from free public transportation across the Trentino region; all the lab members can participate in an annual contest where commuting milage is logged and scored according to sustainability of the means of transport, the person who accrues the most points wins.<br/>
<br/>
Recycling: To minimize the environmental impact of lab waste, we avoid mixing truly contaminated materials (which is expensive and environmentally harmful to safely dispose of) with clean recyclable waste. We equip our lab with additional recycling bins and take responsibility for disposing of the recovered recyclables according to local <br/>regulations. 
<br/>
Economical use of equipment: when possible and not detrimental our instruments, we turn off unused equipment when prolonged downtime is forecasted.<br/>

<summary> <b> <code> ... the common lab language and any institutional language requirements. </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i><b>Details: </b> English is the international language of science in the 21st century: proficiency in English is a crucial skill to nurture for every scientist. However, lab members are often not native English speakers, and in some cases the Institutional language may not be English. It is therefore important to document the lab and institutional language policy (even in “obvious” cases). To help non-native English speakers—or non-native speakers of the local language—it is also valuable to highlight any institutional support for language acquisition. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Suggestions:</b> <br/>
-Identify English as the lab language, and document language code of conduct. <br/>
-Lead by example and adopt the most inclusive communication format. <br/>
-Clearly indicate language requirements in job posts. <br/>
-Document available training in English, particularly scientific writing and presentation. <br/>
-Document available training in the Institutional and/or local language.  <br/>
-Document lab policy about using LLMs (i.e. ChatGPT) to improve written output. <br/>
-Address language barriers in meetings, adopting formats of Q/A that facilitate feedback. <br/>
  <br/>
<b>Example: </b> <br/>
The lab language is English. Any professional conversation, oral and written, during work activities must be in English: these include presentations and discussion at lab meetings, scientific output, and email exchanges. Feel free to use LLMs to proofread and refine written text. However, fully AI generated text is not acceptable. Outside of professional meetings, the lab strives for inclusive communication: verbal exchanges should adopt the common language that allow everyone present to participate. <br/>
<br/>
The institutional language at the Italian Institute of Technology is English; nonetheless, many administrative exchanges and Italian bureaucracy are still in Italian. Proficiency in Italian is therefore useful within the institute, as well as when traveling throughout the country. Please refer to the lab Wiki to access learning resources. <br/>

<summary> <b> <code> ... the procedure for reporting bullying and/or harassment. </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i><b>Details: </b> Bullying and harassment are serious allegations and entirely unacceptable in any work environment. By explicitly highlighting the procedure for reporting these issues, group leaders not only demonstrate their commitment to eradicating these behaviours, but also increase the chance that violations witnessed by lab members will be reported. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Suggestions:</b> <br/>
-Specify how bullying and harassment is defined by the institution. <br/>
-Document institutional procedures for reporting and any supporting body/resources available. <br/>
-Disseminate and value training events offered by the institution. <br/>
  <br/>
<b>Example: </b> <br/>
Students and trainees who feel they have experienced or witnessed bullying harassment or sexual misconduct by another student may make a formal report to XXXX by email. This process may also be initiated through Human resources, the lab manager, or group leader.  <br/>
<br/>
Members of staff who feel they have experienced or witnessed bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct may make a formal complaint against a staff member by using the Staff Grievance Policy or they may make a formal complaint against a student by contacting XXXX by email. <br/>
<br/>
Students or members of staff who feel they have experienced or witnessed bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct by a third party, or a member of the public, should discuss this with their line manager, supervisor or personal tutor in the first instance. This may involve notifying third parties and using their complaints procedure or notifying Security and/or the police when involving members of the public.  <br/>
<br/>
<ins>Outcome of a complaint/ disciplinary case</ins><br/>
The Reporting Party will be told whether their complaint has been upheld or not; and whether the Reported Party has been dismissed or expelled. If the complaint is not upheld or the Reported Party is not dismissed or expelled, information will be shared with the Reporting Party to minimise any adverse effects in accessing their work or study environment, where possible, but there may be limits to the information about the consequences to the Reported Party that can be shared with the Reporting Party.  <br/>
<br/>
Where the Reporting Party is told the outcome they will be asked to respect confidentiality with regards to the outcome. Links to institute guidelines and contact information of the person in charge for each group are provided as hyperlinks above.  <br/>

<summary> <b> <code> ... available resources to support mental health. </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i><b>Details: </b> Thankfully, awareness and support for mental health issues within work environments is at an all-time high. It is likely that these issues will arise within any research group at some time, and it is equally likely that the group leader is not qualified to offer advice or guidance—particularly given the potential for a conflict-of-interest. It is therefore critical that lab members are made aware of the resources available to them at both an institutional and national level. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Suggestions:</b> <br/>
-Should lab members approach you with work-related and/or non-work-related issues? <br/>
-Educate lab members on mental health, and how to prevent and recognise arising issues. <br/>
-Document institutional resources for psychological support. <br/>
-Highlight the institutional policy on mental health and sick leave. <br/>
-Promote good practices to safe-guard mental health (e.g. work-life balance).  <br/>
  <br/>
<b>Example: </b> <br/>
Mental well-being is crucial for personal and professional success, especially given the prevalence of mental health challenges in academia (https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.4089). High productivity doesn’t equate to overwork. Lab members are encouraged to manage their productivity responsibly and are not expected to exceed working regular work hours. If you feel comfortable, I encourage you to discuss any personal challenges that may affect your work during our 1-on-1 meetings. If you need additional support, I encourage you to consider the following resources:<br/>
<br/>
Counseling Services: Our institution offers free counseling services [link] and free 1-on-1 coaching [link] for all students and employees. Please also consult the institute’s resources on a healthy work-life balance [link].<br/>
<br/>
Medical Services: Our institution's medical services can guide you to professional mental health resources. Please refer to [link, phone number] for details. Additionally, please consult the institute’s policy on sick leave [link].<br/>
<br/>
Crisis Hotlines: If you or someone you know is in immediate need of support, please contact the National Crisis Hotlines at [phone number(s)].

<summary> <b> <code> ... the procedure for raising lab or inter-personal issues. </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i><b>Details: </b> One prominent reason that lab and inter-personal issues are not raised in a timely and constructive fashion is the lack of a documented procedure for this process. Having a clear and transparent procedure encourages feedback from lab members, makes them more comfortable initiating feedback as the expectation is clear, and increases the likelihood that issues can be addressed before they deteriorate. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Suggestions:</b> <br/>
-Specify that issues raised in 1-on-1 meetings won’t be acted on without discussion.  <br/>
-Specify a reporting procedure that circumvents you if necessary. <br/>
-Provide an avenue for lab members to raise concerns with you anonymously. <br/>
  <br/>
<b>Example: </b> <br/>
1.	If comfortable doing so, request a meeting to raise the issue with the group leader. <br/>
2.	If not, please raise the issue anonymously by using this form. <br/>
3.	If external involvement would be beneficial, contact our dedicated external advisor. <br/>
4.	If none of the above steps fare appropriate, raise the issue with HR here. <br/>

<summary> <b> <code> ... a shared lab calendar for members to indicate if they are away, at conferences etc. </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i><b>Details: </b>  This not only makes it clear when regular meetings should be cancelled, or when a lab member should not be expected to respond to emails, but also normalizes the lab policy (whatever that may be) regarding conferences, remote working, vacation etc. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Suggestions:</b> <br/>
-Clear instructions for reporting different statuses (e.g. vacation vs conference attendance).<br/>
-What specific details should be reported? (e.g. half-day vs full day).<br/>
  <br/>
</details>

## SAFE Policies
**I commit to _publicly document_ …**
<details>
<summary> <b> <code> ... a list of lab members and alumni. </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i><b>Details: </b> A clear and current list of lab members allows prospective applicants to gauge the size and composition of the lab. Unless otherwise requested, <b> contact details for each person should be included.</b> Adding alumni indicates the range of roles that lab members move into after leaving, and provides an avenue to gain more information about joining, working in, and leaving the lab. <br/>
<br/>
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b> <code> ... an overview of the regular meetings in the lab, and my expectations for participation. </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i><b>Details: </b> Labs often have a variety of regular meetings, including 1-on-1 meetings, lab meetings and journal clubs. However, the expectations for the contents of these meetings are rarely documented, leading to misunderstandings and uncertainty. Clear documentation not only reveals useful information about lab life, but also ensures that meetings are more effective and fruitful. <b> As a minimum, this should include the frequency, duration, and the agenda for each type of meeting. </b> <br/>
<br/>
<b>Suggestions:</b> <br/>
-Discuss 1-on-1 meeting frequency at onboarding, and review in annual appraisals. <br/>
-Create a shared space where past presentations can be accessed.<br/>
-Encourage participation and involvement from all lab members, for example:
  1. Round table feedback
  2. Lab members write down their thoughts, then all of them are read.
  3. Allocate time in meetings for problem solving and a brainstorming session.
  4. Have a meeting facilitator and/or note taker; rotate among lab members.
-Conduct regular team-building activities (e.g. lab retreat, dinners, celebrations).<br/>
  <br/>
<b>Example: </b> <br/>
Discussing scientific progress is essential for the success of our projects. I expect all lab members to actively participate in our scheduled meetings: <br/>
 <br/>
Lab Meetings: Each lab member will host our weekly lab meeting on a rotating schedule, presenting an informal progress report. These reports, lasting 20-30 minutes, should succinctly introduce your project, highlight the main research questions, and focus on recent achievements and challenges. This allows for productive group discussions to advance your project. Lab meetings are typically held once per week within core working hours, lasting 60 to 90 minutes. Progress report presentations are accessible via our lab’s shared resources. <br/>
 <br/>
Journal Club: On a rotating schedule, each lab member will present the core hypotheses, methods, results, and conclusions of a recent original research paper relevant to our lab’s research in our monthly journal club. All members are expected to read the paper and actively participate in discussing its strengths, weaknesses, and key takeaways. The journal club is typically held once per week within core working hours and lasts about 60 minutes. <br/>
 <br/>
1-on-1 Meetings: I schedule bi-weekly 1-on-1 in-person meetings which each lab member, typically lasting around 1 hour, during core work hours [details below]. These meetings are designed to support you in successfully implementing your research project. I am also available for additional meetings upon request. <br/>
 <br/>
Yearly Appraisals: I will review your project's long-term progress and provide tailored feedback on your work performance during yearly appraisals. This is also an opportunity for you to give me feedback on your experience working in the lab, and under my supervision.
