## I commit to _publicly document_ a diversity statement.

Details: Science is an international endeavour, which brings together people from many cultures. This statement is an opportunity to specify the steps you, and your institution, have taken to support a diversity of researchers with differing needs and backgrounds.

Suggestions:
-Make clear what are the institutional rules for maternity and paternity leave.
-Normalize specifying pronouns in email signatures and profiles (e.g. slack).
-Encourage people to share and mark on the lab calendar crucial cultural events/festivities.
-Encourage attendance of EDI training.
-Discuss steps taken to facilitate diversity in applicants.
-During onboarding, discuss cultural needs (e.g. religious holidays, prayer facilities).
-Dedicate some meetings (e.g. journal club) to papers addressing diversity in science.
-Consider diversity of voices when selecting papers in journal clubs.

Example: Our lab fosters a diverse and inclusive environment. We believe that diversity is a resource to harness, and we strive to create a psychologically safe environment where disruptive points of view are valued. We encourage individuals from different cultural, socioeconomic, gender, and geographical backgrounds to join.
