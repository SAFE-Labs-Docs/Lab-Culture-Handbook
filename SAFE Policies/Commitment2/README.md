## I commit to _publicly document_ a list of lab members and alumni.

_**Details:**_ A clear and current list of lab members allows prospective applicants to gauge the size and composition of the lab. Unless otherwise requested, contact details for each person should be included. Adding alumni indicates the range of roles that lab members move into after leaving, and provides an avenue to gain more information about joining, working in, and leaving the lab.
