## SAFE Policies
<details>
<summary> <b> <code>Diversity statement </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i>Our lab fosters a diverse and inclusive environment. We believe that diversity is a resource to harness, and we strive to create a psychologically safe environment where disruptive points of view are valued. We encourage individuals from different cultural, socioeconomic, gender, and geographical backgrounds to join.</i>
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b> <code> Code of conduct </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i> All lab members are expected to maintain a professional attitude of integrity, accountability, and mutual respect in all interactions and endeavours while upholding high standards of scientific rigor and collaboration. Examples include respecting each other’s points of views and contributions to discussions, being timely for meetings, and actively engaging in each other’s presentations. Everyone commits to maintaining an inclusive environment marked by compassionate behaviour and free from offensive conduct, particularly regarding gender, race, sexuality, or disability. Lab members are free to voice their ideas, wishes, or concerns without risking negative consequences ensuring a psychologically safe environment.</i>
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b> <code> Green lab and sustainability </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i>The lab strives to minimise energy consumption and waste production. We identified three main areas of impact: travel, recycling and economical use of equipment. <br/>
<br/>
Travel: I encourage sustainable transport options both for long-haul travel and for daily commute. For long-hauls trips, when funding allows, I will cover the most sustainable travel option (up to double the price of the cheapest alternative). I also recognise remote-working hours spent productively on sustainable means of transport during private (non-work related) trips. I incentivize sustainable options for daily commute: PhD students enrolled at University of Trento benefit from free public transportation across the Trentino region; all the lab members can participate in an annual contest where commuting milage is logged and scored according to sustainability of the means of transport, the person who accrues the most points wins.<br/>
<br/>
Recycling: To minimize the environmental impact of lab waste, we avoid mixing truly contaminated materials (which is expensive and environmentally harmful to safely dispose of) with clean recyclable waste. We equip our lab with additional recycling bins and take responsibility for disposing of the recovered recyclables according to local <br/>regulations.
<br/>
Economical use of equipment: when possible and not detrimental our instruments, we turn off unused equipment when prolonged downtime is forecasted. </i>
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b> <code> Lab language </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i>The lab language is English. Any professional conversation, oral and written, during work activities must be in English: these include presentations and discussion at lab meetings, scientific output, and email exchanges. Feel free to use LLMs to proofread and refine written text. However, fully AI generated text is not acceptable. Outside of professional meetings, the lab strives for inclusive communication: verbal exchanges should adopt the common language that allow everyone present to participate. <br/>
<br/>
The institutional language at the Italian Institute of Technology is English; nonetheless, many administrative exchanges and Italian bureaucracy are still in Italian. Proficiency in Italian is therefore useful within the institute, as well as when traveling throughout the country. Please refer to the lab Wiki to access learning resources. <br/>

<summary> <b> <code> Reporting bullying and/or harassment. </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i>
Students and trainees who feel they have experienced or witnessed bullying harassment or sexual misconduct by another student may make a formal report to XXXX by email. This process may also be initiated through Human resources, the lab manager, or group leader.  <br/>
<br/>
Members of staff who feel they have experienced or witnessed bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct may make a formal complaint against a staff member by using the Staff Grievance Policy or they may make a formal complaint against a student by contacting XXXX by email. <br/>
<br/>
Students or members of staff who feel they have experienced or witnessed bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct by a third party, or a member of the public, should discuss this with their line manager, supervisor or personal tutor in the first instance. This may involve notifying third parties and using their complaints procedure or notifying Security and/or the police when involving members of the public.  <br/>
<br/>
<ins>Outcome of a complaint/ disciplinary case</ins><br/>
The Reporting Party will be told whether their complaint has been upheld or not; and whether the Reported Party has been dismissed or expelled. If the complaint is not upheld or the Reported Party is not dismissed or expelled, information will be shared with the Reporting Party to minimise any adverse effects in accessing their work or study environment, where possible, but there may be limits to the information about the consequences to the Reported Party that can be shared with the Reporting Party.  <br/>
<br/>
Where the Reporting Party is told the outcome they will be asked to respect confidentiality with regards to the outcome. Links to institute guidelines and contact information of the person in charge for each group are provided as hyperlinks above.  <br/>

<summary> <b> <code> Mental health support </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i> Mental well-being is crucial for personal and professional success, especially given the prevalence of mental health challenges in academia (https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.4089). High productivity doesn’t equate to overwork. Lab members are encouraged to manage their productivity responsibly and are not expected to exceed working regular work hours. If you feel comfortable, I encourage you to discuss any personal challenges that may affect your work during our 1-on-1 meetings. If you need additional support, I encourage you to consider the following resources:<br/>
<br/>
Counseling Services: Our institution offers free counseling services [link] and free 1-on-1 coaching [link] for all students and employees. Please also consult the institute’s resources on a healthy work-life balance [link].<br/>
<br/>
Medical Services: Our institution's medical services can guide you to professional mental health resources. Please refer to [link, phone number] for details. Additionally, please consult the institute’s policy on sick leave [link].<br/>
<br/>
Crisis Hotlines: If you or someone you know is in immediate need of support, please contact the National Crisis Hotlines at [phone number(s)].

<br/>
<i> A list of current and past lab members can be found here: link <br/>
<br/>
  </i>
</details>


<details>
<summary> <b> <code> Working hours, remote working, and vacation. </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i>I am committed to creating a healthy work environment for all lab members that prioritises mental health and wellbeing. Academic neuroscience should be an exciting, rewarding, and engaging job. Certainly, it can be challenging, and stressful at times, but it should not be depressing, or life-consuming. I anticipate all lab members taking a minimum of XXX’s prescribed 41 days of annual leave. “Minimum” because if experiments necessitate working on a weekend, or you attend a conference that’s scheduled on a weekend, I support lab members taking time off to compensate for this. I hope to schedule all meetings within UCL’s “core” work hours of 10am to 4pm. And I will refrain from sending, or answering, non-urgent emails/messages outside of work hours.<br/>
  <br/>
  All full-time lab members should aim to work onsite at least four days a week. I expect this number to reduce (probably to “three”)  once the lab is operational and more time is being spent analysing data rather than building rigs/training mice. In general, I believe that some regular onsite presence is important to maintain the lab community. However, I am happy to support intermittent periods of fully-remote working when, for example, traveling/visiting family abroad or writing up a thesis/grant.

<details>
<summary> <b> <code> Lab meetings </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i> Discussing scientific progress is essential for the success of our projects. I expect all lab members to actively participate in our scheduled meetings: <br/>
 <br/>
Lab Meetings: Each lab member will host our weekly lab meeting on a rotating schedule, presenting an informal progress report. These reports, lasting 20-30 minutes, should succinctly introduce your project, highlight the main research questions, and focus on recent achievements and challenges. This allows for productive group discussions to advance your project. Lab meetings are typically held once per week within core working hours, lasting 60 to 90 minutes. Progress report presentations are accessible via our lab’s shared resources. <br/>
 <br/>
Journal Club: On a rotating schedule, each lab member will present the core hypotheses, methods, results, and conclusions of a recent original research paper relevant to our lab’s research in our monthly journal club. All members are expected to read the paper and actively participate in discussing its strengths, weaknesses, and key takeaways. The journal club is typically held once per week within core working hours and lasts about 60 minutes. <br/>
 <br/>
1-on-1 Meetings: I schedule bi-weekly 1-on-1 in-person meetings which each lab member, typically lasting around 1 hour, during core work hours [details below]. These meetings are designed to support you in successfully implementing your research project. I am also available for additional meetings upon request. <br/>
 <br/>
Yearly Appraisals: I will review your project's long-term progress and provide tailored feedback on your work performance during yearly appraisals. This is also an opportunity for you to give me feedback on your experience working in the lab, and under my supervision.

<summary> <b> <code> Lab roles manual </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i> Our team is composed by researchers with different roles: post-doctoral researchers, PhD students, undergraduate (Master or Bachelor) students and research assistants/engineers. These roles, which may correspond to different career stages and seniority, typically come with different duties and responsibilities. Typical responsibilities are summarised by the table below. Exceptions may be made in discussion with me—typically during onboarding.</i>

<summary> <b> <code> Onboarding of new lab members. </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i>  Arriving in a new lab, town, and often country can be a challenging process. The lab has developed an onboarding procedure to help make this process go as smoothly as possible. There are institutional administrative activities that must be performed, and these are listed on the Wiki, along with details about how to complete them [Link]. In addition, every new lab member is paired with a “lab buddy” (an existing member of the lab) who will arrange for you to meet each lab member individually and hear about the work they are doing.

Unless I am traveling, we will have our first 1-on-1 meeting during your first day in the lab. This will include a discussion of your project in the lab, but also guidance on how you can access all the information and lab policies specified in the SAFE Labs Lab Culture Handbook.
</i>
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b> <code> Resource and Instrument equity  </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i> I strive to ensure that all lab members in the same role have access to the resources they need to complete their project and advance their career. These include the financial resources to purchase equipment and attend conferences, sufficient access to shared resources (e.g. microscopes and behavioural rigs), and time/help from lab technicians and engineers. Anticipated resource requirements will be discussed at onboarding, and I keep a record of expenditure on different projects to ensure there are no major discrepancies. We have established systems for booking shared equipment and technician hours [Link] which act as a historical record to ensure that these resources are not unfairly distributed. If you perceive any inequalities in the distribution of lab resources, please raise your concerns with me according to the procedure for raising lab or inter-personal issues [Link].  <br/>
<br/>
The above policies pertain to communal lab resources. Individuals with their own grants which, for example, allow them to hire a technician or travel to conferences will have exclusive (in the case of travel funding) or priority (in the case of staff or shared equipment) access to these resources.

## SAFE Careers

<details>
<summary> <b> <code> Authorship </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i>  Authorship vs acknowledgement is not always clear for a publication, but typically all contributors to a paper are included as authors, where contribution is broadly defined by <a href="https://credit.niso.org/">CRediT Taxonomy</a>. For example, developing a new technique for a project, or contributing previously unpublished data/figures would constitute authorship. Conversely, routine experimental work, sharing basic analysis code, or proof-reading a paper would not constitute authorship. Authorship is ultimately decided in discussions between the group leader, project lead(s), and any other potential authors. Although the scientific process is unpredictable, authorship will be discussed when a lab member begins, or becomes involved with, a project. Whenever possible, we publish a matrix of contributions at the end of each paper.</i>
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b> <code> Expectations from lab members. </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i> Every PhD and postdoctoral researcher position in the lab inevitably has its own set of experimental challenges and funding complications. Therefore, it is impossible to predict the outcome of any project, and I cannot make guarantees with respect to timelines or publications. However, my ambition for each role is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<b>PhD students </b> in the UK typically graduate ~4 years after joining the lab, and it is my aim that each student has at least one first (or co-first) authored publication on bioRxiv at that time. I select PhD projects (in discussion with the student) with this aim in mind. Depending on the current funding status of the lab, it is often possible for students to remain in the lab for a period after their PhD, and this will be discussed at least one year in advance of graduation.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Postdoctoral researchers </b> typically join the lab with an initial contract, and the length of that contract depends on both the source of funding and their proposed project. All positions in the university are also subject a 12-month probationary period. I will be transparent about these restrictions in the initial job advertisement, and in discussions with any applicant. I aim to propose projects (in discussion with the researcher) to maximise the chance of a publication within the initial contract’s timeframe. At least one year before the end of the contract period, I will discuss the next steps with the researcher, which may include the option to stay longer in the lab (with or without applying for their own funding).
</i>
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b> <code> Conference/summer school attendance. </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i> I encourage all lab members to seek and apply for training opportunities to develop new expertise, and the lab values initiative to disseminate the lab research at conferences. <br/>
<br/>
Each postdoctoral researcher and PhD student has a budget of £1000 per year to attend conferences. This can be accumulated across years if that is the preference, and can be used for one expensive conference or multiple inexpensive conferences. Lab members do not need to present anything when attending their first conference after joining the lab, but should present at any future conferences, or organize a workshop/symposium, if they are planning to attend. If lab members have additional funds through grants or their PhD programme, these can be used in addition to the £1000 annual budget. I am happy to make an exception to this rule and provide extra funds if allowed by current grants, and an excellent opportunity arises (e.g. a unique conference, an invitation to give a prestigious talk) that would exceed this budget, but lab members should discuss with me before making any commitments. <br/>
<br/>
Typically, I expect both PhD students and postdoctoral researchers to attend a competitive training school and/or a conference by the end of their second year in the lab. The lab will support applications (e.g. with recommendation letters) to these initiatives when they align with a project interest or planned career development. When funds are available, and application to fees waivers are not successful, the lab will cover the costs.<br/>
<br/>
Master’s students, undergraduates, and lab technicians are also encouraged to attend conferences if they have work to present. They should discuss these opportunities in advance with me. Often, there are grants available from conference organisers to support attendance, and if this is not the case, or the application for funds is unsuccessful, I will consider funding attendance on a case-by-case basis.
</i>
</details>


<details>
<summary> <b> <code> Completing previous work after joining the lab. </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i> I understand that postdoctoral researchers joining the lab may have ongoing work from their previous position and I support them taking time to complete this work. The period during which they will need to continue previous work is understandably hard to predict, but ideally it will not last longer than 1 year. If finishing previous work is expected to last longer than 1 year, postdoctoral researchers should delay the start of their position in the lab whenever possible. Time spent on previous work should not exceed ~25%.</i>
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b> <code> Funding for postdoctoral researchers. </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i> At XXX, salaries for postdoctoral researchers are determined by a national grading system [link]. All postdoctoral researchers in the lab start on grade XXXX, unless they have significant prior postdoctoral experience (e.g. have already completed a post doc in a lab other than their PhD lab). At the end of each year, salaries increase by one point on this grading system. <br/>
<br/>
All postdoctoral researchers are required to apply for followships, both to benefit their own career and to improve lab finances. However, being awarded a fellowship is not a requirement. In cases when a researcher acquires their own funding through a competitive fellowship [Link], this often comes with an increased salary. It may also come with dedicated funding for a lab technician to be managed by the researcher.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible for postdoctoral fellows to be promoted to a senior-researcher level through an established institutional process. This is often most successful after acquiring their own grant or publishing a paper. I encourage all researchers to apply for promotion and will review the possibility during annual appraisals.<br/>
<br/>
I will be transparent with postdoctoral researchers about the available funding for their position when they join the lab, and will discuss any.
</i>
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b> <code> VISA support. </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i>  Visa costs when joining the lab from outside the UK vary by the applicant’s citizenship, but are typically £5,000, comprising application costs, required language tests, and annual NHS contributions. The process typically takes 3-6 months, although this can vary significantly. At the time of writing, we typically cover all costs related to the visa process. However, this can be position-dependent: please refer to the job advertisement for more specific details.</i>
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b> <code> Reference letters. </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i>  Reference letters will be provided to lab members at request, but these requests should be made at least 2 weeks in advance of the deadline for the first reference letter, and at least 1 week in advance for subsequent letters. Lab members should expect fair but honest evaluation of their performance and skills in the reference letters provided. As a rule, any additional supervisors (for example, a postdoctoral researcher who has supervised a student) of the lab member will be invited to contribute and sign the requested reference letter.</i>
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b> <code> Leaving the lab </code> </b>  <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
<i> I aim to provide lab members with mentorship and support to secure the next career step in their career. Job and/or grant applications, and preparing for subsequent interviews, takes time. Typically, after discussions during 1-on-1 meetings, I support dedicating up to 25% of research time to this endeavour. <br/>
<br/>
I am best equipped to help with academic career trajectories: I offer mentorship at 1-on-1 meetings and will devote time to rehearse interview talks. However, academia is one of many available career paths.  For career paths outside academia, the institute, and external organisations (e.g. Nature Jobs fair), offer events and workshops. I support lab members making use of these resources. <br/>
<br/>
I understand that people decide to leave the lab for different reasons, and may need to do so before their projects are complete. I ask that lab members discuss their plans with me as early as possible—preferably at least 6 months before their intended departure. This helps to ensure a smooth leaving process: the final months will include the hand-over of any knowledge and data needed to ensure documentation, continuity and completion of ongoing projects. As the final step prior to departure, I will organise an exit interview, carried out in private with a colleague (e.g. a SAFE lab network associate). During the interview, departing lab members will be able to discuss the reasons for leaving and provide constructive feedback based on their experience.
